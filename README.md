Drinking Buddy
==============

Hooray drinking stats.


## Setup

You'll need to include your Untappd API keys. Inside the `src/app/factories` directory, there is an `untappdKeys-sample.js` file that includes a factory that returns the Untappd keys. Copy this file to `src/app/factories/untappdKeys.js` and update the file with valid keys. Then run the `gulp js` task on a command line to compile to the `dist` directory.
