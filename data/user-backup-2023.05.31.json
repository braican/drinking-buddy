Featuring a layered hop approach and drawing from the lessons learned in our Find the Limit series, The Greenest Green is ridiculously hop saturated yet flavorful on the palate.  Pouring a milky yellow color in the glass it hits your senses with a true wow factor with overwhelming notes of pineapple and tropical fruit. Finishing with a sharp but short-lived bitterness, it retains beautiful balance in spite of the hop onslaught it brings.  At ten years we remain invigorated and inspired by what the future holds for Tree House. This project has brought us so much joy-- your trust and support has given us this opportunity, and we are eternally grateful for that.","auth_rating":4.25,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":20084,"brewery_name":"Tree House Brewing Company","brewery_slug":"tree-house-brewing-company","brewery_page_url":"/treehousebrewco","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https://assets.untappd.com/site/brewery_logos/brewery-treehousebrewingcompany_20084.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"TreeHouseBrewCo","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/treehousebrewco","instagram":"TreeHouseBrewCo","url":"http://www.treehousebrew.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Charlton","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.1400986,"lng":-72.0152969},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":10633910,"venue_name":"Tree House Brewing Company - Deerfield","venue_slug":"tree-house-brewing-company-deerfield","primary_category_key":"Nightlife Spot","primary_category":"Nightlife Spot","parent_category_id":"4d4b7105d754a06376d81259","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"brewery","category_name":"Brewery","category_id":"50327c8591d4c4b30a586d5d","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"1 Community Place","venue_city":"Deerfield","venue_state":"MA","venue_country":"United States","lat":42.4906197,"lng":-72.6099167},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":"https://treehousebrew.com/deerfield"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"60c2dbae613eb263613985ca","foursquare_url":"https://4sq.com/3wf3FxW"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https://assets.untappd.com/venuelogos/venue_10633910_0e6588ce_bg_64.png","md":"https://assets.untappd.com/venuelogos/venue_10633910_0e6588ce_bg_88.png","lg":"https://assets.untappd.com/venuelogos/venue_10633910_0e6588ce_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true}},{"photo_id":317043032,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_09_13/e448b0e56b9277a985c070418b43cda8_200x200.jpg","photo_img_md":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_09_13/e448b0e56b9277a985c070418b43cda8_640x640.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_09_13/e448b0e56b9277a985c070418b43cda8_1280x1280.jpg","photo_img_og":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_09_13/e448b0e56b9277a985c070418b43cda8_raw.jpg"},"created_at":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 10:24:33 +0000","checkin_id":942022490,"user":{"uid":790421,"user_name":"braican","location":"Portland, OR","bio":"","first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Braica","user_avatar":"https://assets.untappd.com/profile/f2f682728dc66312e6c0ea2cc9508f0b_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","url":"http://braican.com"},"beer":{"bid":1676734,"beer_name":"Helldorado (2016)","beer_label":"https://assets.untappd.com/site/beer_logos/beer-87275_972e7_sm.jpeg","beer_abv":11.8,"beer_style":"Barleywine - American","beer_description":"Part of the adventure of aging beer in retired spirits barrels is the synergistic interaction of different malt flavors with the oak and spirit flavors from the barrel. Darker beers like stouts and darker barley wines have typically been the favored candidates for barrel-aging, due to their deeper caramel and roasted flavors. Helldorado breaks that mold with a deep golden color from being brewed solely with English and American pale malts. The bready, honeyed flavors of pale malts pull out rich wildflower honey, vanilla and coconut notes from the oak, creating an overall flavor evocative of bourbon-glazed graham crackers that stands as singularly unique in our Vintage lineup. Helldorado may be lighter in color but it is a full-bodied and densely concentrated sipper at 11.8% ABV.","auth_rating":5,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":524,"brewery_name":"Firestone Walker Brewing Company","brewery_slug":"firestone-walker-brewing-company","brewery_page_url":"/firestonewalker","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https://assets.untappd.com/site/brewery_logos/brewery-524_96d52.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"FirestoneWalker","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/firestone.walker/","instagram":"firestonewalker","url":"http://www.firestonebeer.com/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Paso Robles","brewery_state":"CA","lat":35.5952988,"lng":-120.6940002},"brewery_active":1},"venue":[]},{"photo_id":301006791,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_06_25/c3aca8654c473a39e91f583bbf378771_200x200.jpg","photo_img_md":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_06_25/c3aca8654c473a39e91f583bbf378771_640x640.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_06_25/c3aca8654c473a39e91f583bbf378771_1280x1280.jpg","photo_img_og":"https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2020_06_25/c3aca8654c473a39e91f583bbf378771_raw.jpg"},"created_at":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 23:17:46 +0000","checkin_id":910302217,"user":{"uid":790421,"user_name":"braican","location":"Portland, OR","bio":"","first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Braica","user_avatar":"https://assets.untappd.com/profile/f2f682728dc66312e6c0ea2cc9508f0b_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","url":"http://braican.com"},"beer":{"bid":3733112,"beer_name":"On The Fly","beer_label":"https://assets.untappd.com/site/beer_logos/beer-3733112_ebf2b_sm.jpeg","beer_abv":8.1,"beer_style":"IPA - Imperial / Double","beer_description":"On The Fly is a Double IPA by Tree House Brewing Company.
